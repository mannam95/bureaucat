## Features

- **Project-based task management** with sequential IDs (e.g. `DEVOP-123`), priorities, labels, and workflow states
- **Tamper-proof audit log** with SHA-256 hash chain verification on every action
- **Mattermost integration** with DM notifications for assignments and mentions (extensible to Slack, email, etc.)
- **Single sign-on** via Google and Zitadel (OIDC)
- **Role-based access** at both system level (admin/user) and project level (guest/member/admin)
- **Single binary deployment** with embedded frontend and migrations
- **File uploads** with configurable storage

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | Go 1.25 + [Echo v5](https://echo.labstack.com/) |
| Frontend | [Nuxt 4](https://nuxt.com/) (Vue 3.5) + TypeScript |
| Database | PostgreSQL 18 + [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev/) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 + [shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/) |
| Package Manager | [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (frontend) |

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- `make`, plus `openssl`, `curl`, and `python3` on the host (used by `make bootstrap` / `make seed`)

### Development

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/bureaucatorg/bureaucat.git
cd bureaucat

# One command: creates .env, generates object-storage config, builds the
# stack, runs DB migrations, and seeds a rich demo workspace.
make dev-bootstrap        # `make bootstrap` is a shorthand alias
```

This starts:
- **Go API** at `http://localhost:1341` (with hot reload)
- **Nuxt dev server** at `http://localhost:3041`
- **PostgreSQL** on port 5432
- **pgweb** (DB explorer) at `http://localhost:8081`

Then open `http://localhost:1341` and sign in with the demo account
**demo@gmail.com** / **Passw0rd!**. `make dev-bootstrap` also seeds a rich demo
workspace (users, projects, sprints, epics, tasks + sub-tasks) via `make seed`.

Run `make help` for the full command list — dev lifecycle
(`make dev-up` / `dev-down` / `dev-logs`), attach/exec (`make dev-attach` /
`make dev-shell`), database (`make migrate` / `make seed`), prod
(`make prod-bootstrap` / `make prod-up`), and `make nuke` to wipe everything
for this repo.

### Production

```bash
make prod-bootstrap      # or: make prod-up
```

Builds a single Go binary with the frontend embedded and serves everything on port `1341`.

> **Note — you can't run dev and prod at the same time.** Both bind port `1341`
> and share the `bureaucat-garage` container name, and by design the prod compose
> file reuses the same `.env`, `garage/garage.toml`, and `postgres-data/` as dev.
> `make dev-bootstrap` / `make prod-bootstrap` each stop and remove the other
> stack first, so switching is safe; if you started with `make dev-up`, run
> `make dev-down` before `make prod-up`. A real deployment should use its own
> `.env` and storage.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `JWT_SECRET` | Yes | - | Secret key for JWT signing (min 32 chars) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | - | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY_MINS` | No | `5` | Access token lifetime in minutes |
| `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY_DAYS` | No | `7` | Refresh token lifetime in days |
| `UPLOADS_DIR` | No | `./uploads` | File upload storage path |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE` | No | `5242880` | Max upload size in bytes (5MB) |

### Integrations

Configure via the **Admin > Integrations** panel:

- **Mattermost** - DM notifications for task assignments and @mentions. Requires a bot token and server URL.
- **SSO** - Google and Zitadel single sign-on. Configure client credentials in Admin > Authentication.

## API

API documentation is available at `/docs` when running the server (Swagger UI).

To regenerate docs:

```bash
swag init -g cmd/bureaucat/main.go -o docs
```

## Known Limitations

**Reusing a soft-deleted project or workspace key.** Projects and workspaces are soft-deleted (the row is kept with a `deleted_at` timestamp), and the uniqueness of `project_key` / `workspace_key` still counts the deleted row. So after deleting a project whose key is `WEB`, creating a new project with the key `WEB` is rejected as a duplicate. This only affects admins and is rare. To free the key, hard-delete the leftover row directly in the database (this cascades to its tasks, cycles, pages, etc.):

```sql
DELETE FROM projects WHERE project_key = 'WEB' AND deleted_at IS NOT NULL;
```

Use the same shape for workspaces (`workspace_key`). If you would rather keep the old project restorable, rename its key instead of deleting it: `UPDATE projects SET project_key = 'WEB_old' WHERE project_key = 'WEB' AND deleted_at IS NOT NULL;`
